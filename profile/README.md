Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm LoÃ¯c, a freelance senior software engineer. I mostly code in Go, and I really
enjoy building Cloud Platforms and Data Planes.

When working with companies, I sometimes have the opportunity to deliver something
generic enough that it can be leveraged by others. When this happens, I do my best
to make it open source. [Nunchi](https://github.com/nunchistudio) is the
organization I publish my professional open source work to.

With the help of the community and [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/nunchistudio),
Nunchi is an organization designing, building, and maintaining open source projects
to help engineering teams deliver consistent, reliable, and scalable Cloud Platforms
and Data Planes.

You can also join us on:
