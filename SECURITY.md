# Security Policy

We deeply appreciate any effort to discover and disclose security vulnerabilities
responsibly.

If you would like to report a vulnerability in one of our products, please send
us an e-mail at <security@nunchi.studio> but **do not file a public issue**.

We take all disclosures very seriously and will do our best to rapidly respond and
verify the vulnerability before taking the necessary steps to fix it. After our
initial reply to your disclosure, which should be directly after receiving it, we
will periodically update you with the status of the fix.
